<p>ISRO's major achievements include developing indigenous launch vehicles (PSLV, GSLV) for cost-effective satellite deployment, pioneering affordable interplanetary missions like Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and Chandrayaan, discovering water on the Moon with Chandrayaan-1, setting records for launching numerous satellites (104 in one go), providing vital services (NavIC, INSAT), and advancing towards human spaceflight (Gaganyaan) and solar observation (Aditya-L1), making India a leading space power. 
Key Milestones & Missions:
Aryabhata (1975): India's first satellite, marking the start of its space journey.
SLV-3 (1980): First indigenous launch vehicle, making India the 7th nation with orbital launch capability.
INSAT System: One of the world's largest domestic communication satellite networks, crucial for telecom, weather, and broadcasting.
Chandrayaan-1 (2008): Discovered water molecules on the Moon.
Mangalyaan (MOM, 2013): India became the first nation to reach Mars orbit on its first attempt, very cost-effectively.
PSLV Record (2017): Launched 104 satellites in a single mission.
Chandrayaan-3 (2023): Soft-landed near the lunar south pole, making India the first country to do so.
Aditya-L1 (2023/2024): India's first solar observatory mission, reached its L1 halo orbit.
