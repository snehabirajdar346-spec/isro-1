<p>ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) conducts diverse space missions, from satellite launches for communication/earth observation (like INSAT, IRS, EOS series) to landmark planetary explorations such as Chandrayaan (Moon) and Mangalyaan (Mars), and solar observation with Aditya-L1. Key recent successes include Chandrayaan-3's lunar south pole landing, while future plans involve the human spaceflight program Gaganyaan, Venus orbiter, and lunar sample return missions. 
Key Completed Missions
<h2>Chandrayaan (Lunar Exploration):</h2>
<b>Chandrayaan-1 (2008):</b> First Indian lunar mission, discovered water molecules on the Moon.<br>
<b>Chandrayaan-2 (2019): </b>Orbiter successful; lander had a partial failure, but orbiter continues.<br>
<b>Chandrayaan-3 (2023):</b> Achieved India's first soft landing on the lunar south pole, making India the first nation to do so.<br>
<b>Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan - 2013):</b> India's first interplanetary mission, successfully reaching Mars orbit.<br>
<b>Aditya-L1 (2023):</b> India's first dedicated solar mission, studying the Sun from the L1 Lagrange point.<br>
<b>XPoSat (2024):</b> First dedicated astronomy mission for X-ray polarization studies.<br>
Satellite Constellations: Extensive series for communication (GSAT), navigation (IRNSS/NavIC), and Earth observation (IRS, EOS). <br>
Major Planned & Future Missions.<br>
<h2>Gaganyaan: </h2>India's human spaceflight program, with crewed and uncrewed test flights planned.<br>
NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar): Joint mission with NASA for dual-band radar imaging.<br>
Chandrayaan-4 / Lunar Polar Exploration Mission: A lunar sample-return mission.<br>
Venus Orbiter Mission: An orbiter to study Venus's atmosphere.<br>
Mars Lander Mission: A follow-up to MOM, including a lander/rover.<br>
SPADEX (Space-based Plasma Depletion Experiment): Demonstrating technology for space debris mitigation. </p>
